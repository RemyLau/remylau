###  🛠 I’m currently developing
- [nleval](https://github.com/krishnanlab/NetworkLearningEval): a toolbox for setting up benchmarking graph datasets using biological network and annotation data from public data sources.
- [PyDANCE](https://github.com/OmicsML/dance): an extensive toolkit for deep learning with single-cell (multi-)omics data.

### 🧰 I'm actively maintaining several packages related to my past / recent projects
- [PecanPy](https://github.com/krishnanlab/PecanPy) [[paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/19/3377/6184859)]: a memory efficient and [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) accelerated Python implementation of [node2vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/) with an improved version [node2vec+](https://github.com/krishnanlab/node2vecplus_benchmarks) [[paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.14.503926v1.abstract)] for weighted graphs. 
- [PyGenePlexus](https://github.com/krishnanlab/PyGenePlexus) [[paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/11/3457/5780279)]: a network-based gene classification service using machine learning and gene interaction network features.
- [GTaxoGym](https://github.com/G-Taxonomy-Workgroup/GTaxoGym) [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07729)]: a taxonomic study of benchmarking graph datasets from various domains based on the GNN model sensitivity to a collection of graph perturbations.
